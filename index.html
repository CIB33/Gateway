       <h1> <u>Overview of Tokyo Japan</u> </h1>
      <p>Tokyo the capitol of Japan with a total of 47 prefectures and 23 central wards. When it comes down to population of Tokyo right now they currently have a estimated 14.1184 Million residing. Due to their unique cuisines, culture, being place where manga is popular as well as anime, having multiple arcades to keep gamers of all ages entertained, where E-sports are taken very seriously, and that innovations in technology itself are always bustling it truly is a place of never ending wonder. For those who're interested in history I must say that the Edo period of Japan would truly be one of the topics in history that you'd would want to learn about but if it's not the history you're into then you can also learn about buddhism. Here we'll be discussing some of my favorite tourist sites as well as what I believe are the current innovaters of technology.</p>
