   <h3>Club Sega: Sega, throughout history it was known as one of the biggest competitors in japan alongside nintendo who were known for their iconic star Mario and who else was better to compete then the fastest hedgehog alive named Sonic. While on the fighting front once the original designer of sega's own fighting game virtua fighter and virtua fighter 2 branched off to develop tekken and then started working for bandai namco. Despite all the competition sega was still in it's golden years with those titles and became such a success that in shinjuku ward of tokyo they have a total of 3 floors filled with numerous games (some even by developers outside of sega such as as street fighter or tekken) and has a total of 200 machines in that one building. Truly, a gamers paradise. </h3>

   <h3>Jump Shop: Shonen Jump, home to some of the worlds most wonderous, memorable, and popular titles such as dragon ball/z/super, HunterxHunter, Naruto, Bleach, and more but despite that it truly never had a place it could call home, until the Jump publishers decided to open up. The most commonly known jump shop is in the shinjiku ward of tokyo where they have plenty of merchandise for to enjoy and show your  support to Jump. Mind you, since this is a shop owned by Jump of course you can't forget they'll have limited time/event items that can only be purchased from there. Regarding merchandise it ranges from toys (action figures, plushies, etc), clothing, trading cards, manga, dvds of jump shows, and even a booth for you to play some shonen games (example being dragon ball heroes). If Club Sega a gamers haven or paridise, then this shop alone is anime/manga heaven</h3>

   <h3>Sobahouse Konjiki Hototogisu, despite being a small ramen shop in the shinjuku ward it truly is a shop that hits your taste buds with a fantastic experience while keeping it at a reasonable price. As a sign of acknowledgment the shop finally received one michelen star on the michelen website (Michelen is a famous french company who creates reviews restuaraunts and determines rather or not it shall receive a star on their site. They also make tourist guides particulary pertaining to the must stop resturaunts of that area) and by their standards it's a sign that it's a good resturaunt. Despite the quality being good and prices being great (example being one of their main entrees cost 900 yen and converted to usd that makes out to 8.95) the only downside I see is that the small restuaraunt only seats 11 people but I must say in the end it's defininently worth the wait</h3>
